About Me
======
Hi everyone! I am a Software Engineer at Northrop Grumman. I recieved my B.S. in Computer Science in 2022. I have had the great fortune to work at different research institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Observatories, and CSULA) in a wide range of interesting research topics:  ___Astrophysics, Materials Science, and Differential Privacy___.

I will be applying for an M.S. in Data Science for Spring 2024, and continue sharepning my skills in machine learning.

My career goals are to do research in an industry setting in machine learning & deep learning. 

I have been fortunate to be part of the Adelante Employee Resource Group (ERG) where I have attended various career panels, mock interviews, and outreach efforts to give back to the future generation of STEM.
