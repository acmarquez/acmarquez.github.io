About Me
======
Hello! I am an undergraduate from California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) who is majoring in Computer Science in Spring 2022. I have had the great fortune to work at different research institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Observatories, and CSULA) in a wide range of interesting research topics:  ___Astrophysics, Materials Science, and Differential Privacy___.

My current goals are to ___obtain a Ph.D___. and pursue a ___mixture of research in an industry setting and pursue teaching at the East Los Angeles College___ and ___give back to the community that raised me___. I am a heavy believer in creating the next generation of STEM researchers. I am to provide much needed oppurtunities to under represented communities by building programs that provide students of all levels the resources needed to help them gain exposure and excel! 

Research Interests
======
I have a deep passion for wanting to pursue research in Machine Learning ever since I took my first course in it back in 2018. I aim to be able to apply my research experience and do research in making machine learning models more computationally feasible on a wide range of hardware, from CPU's to GPU's. I hope to enable better run times for a wide variety of people who practice machine learning (scientist and creatives, such as artists and musician)!

I am also interested in Differential Privacy after my research experience at Carnegie Mellon University! I was able to work in social computing and got exposed to the societly computing. I am interested in creating algortihms that have these qualities: fairness and privacy preserving. I aim to work in making machine learning models that also incorporate these strong beliefs.

I also have a deep passion for Blockchain technology, and I have been heavily invovled in spending my freetime learning about this revolutionary technology.

Other Stuff
======
On my free time I also like to DJ. Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Y8Cudtif0) to one of my favorite mixes!
