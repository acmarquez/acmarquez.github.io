Hello! I am an undergraduate from California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) who is graduating with a __B.S. in Computer Science__ in Spring 2022. I have had the great fortune to work at different research institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Observatories, and CSULA) in a wide range of interesting research topics:  ___Astrophysics, Materials Science, and Differential Privacy___.

My current goals are to ___obtain a Ph.D___. and pursue a ___mixture of research in an industry setting and pursue teaching at the East Los Angeles College___ and ___give back to the community that raised me___. 

I want to help build the next generation of STEM researchers. I aim to provide much needed oppurtunities to under represented communities by building programs that provide students of all levels the resources needed to help them gain exposure and excel!
