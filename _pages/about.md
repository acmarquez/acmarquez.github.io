About Me
======
Hello! I am an undergraduate from California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) who is majoring in Computer Science in Spring 2022. I have had the great fortune to work at different research institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Observatories, and CSULA) in a wide range of interesting research topics  (Astrophysics, Materials Science, and Differential Privacy). 

Research Interests
======
I have a deep passion for wanting to pursue research in Machine Learning ever since I took my first course in it back in 2018. I aim to be able to apply my research experience and do research in making machine learning models more computationally feasible on a wide range of hardware, from CPU's to GPU's. I hope to enable better run times for a wide variety of people who practice machine learning (scientist and creatives, such as artists and musician)!

I also have a deep passion for Blockchain technology, and I have been heavily invovled in spending my freetime learning about this revolutionary technology.

Other Stuff
======
On my free time I also like to DJ. Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Y8Cudtif0) to one of my favorite mixes!
